Here is the procedure to create an executable from the Python source code to run it everywhere.

1) Install py2exe (available on sourceforge. I've used py2exe 0.6.9. It works fine). You might have to add the python executable to your PATH.
2) Open a console and browse to the code's directory (zip file available in OwnCloud in Unifield files/Tools/Checkinternet/src_client)
3) Browse to the source code available here and run: python setup.py py2exe
4) Rename dist/rpc.exe to checkinternet.exe
5) ZIP the "dist" directory and ship it to the IT referants
